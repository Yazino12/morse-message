# morse-message

During your vacation at the seaside, time after time you find old bottles with parchment inside. Out of curiosity, you look into the next bottle and see that there is a message written in Morse code. Your curiosity grows even more - maybe you just found the lost treasure of the pirates! However, you are getting tired of decrypting messages manually. Fortunately, you can program in Ruby and you can help yourself by automating this process.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- [schema.sql](./schema.sql) for creating all tables.
- [data.sql](./data.sql) for populating tables with sample data.
- [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
